# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

Restaurant.create(name: "Eat Fresh be Healthy", owner_id: 5, capacity: 50)

# Restaurant.create(name: "Good View", owner_id: 5, capacity: 15)
#
# Restaurant.create(name: "Nota Bene", owner_id: 5, capacity: 20)
#
# Restaurant.create(name: "Lee Garden", owner_id: 5, capacity: 25)
